## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to host a static website directly from your GitHub repository. Follow these steps to deploy your website to a live URL:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository. Give it a name like `vertex-digital-services`.

### 2. Initialize Git and Push Your Code

- Open a terminal in your project's root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to the staging area
git add .

# Commit your files
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add your GitHub repository as a remote
# Replace <your-repo-url> with the URL of the repository you created
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

# Push your code to the main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

- Go to your repository's **Settings** tab on GitHub.
- In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
- Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch** as the source.
- Select `main` as the branch and `/ (root)` as the folder.
- Click **Save**.

### 4. Access Your Live Website

- After a few minutes, your website will be deployed to a URL like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.
- You can find the exact URL in the **Pages** section of your repository's settings.

That's it! Your website is now live for everyone to see.
